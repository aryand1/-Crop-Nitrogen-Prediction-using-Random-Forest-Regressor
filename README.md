ðŸŒ¾ Crop Nitrogen Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
Welcome to the Crop Nitrogen Prediction project! This repository houses a Python script that leverages the power of the Random Forest Regressor to predict crop nitrogen levels with precision. This comprehensive script covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and the generation of insightful visualizations.

Prerequisites
Before delving into the script, make sure you've got these essential libraries installed:

ðŸ“¦ pandas
ðŸ“¦ scikit-learn
ðŸ“¦ matplotlib
You can easily install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to harness the capabilities of this project:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aryand1/crop-nitrogen-prediction.git
2. Data Preparation
The script is designed to work with CSV data. Ensure your data adheres to the specified format for seamless processing.

3. Run the Script
Execute the Python script using this command:

bash
Copy code
python crop_nitrogen_prediction.py
Results
Upon running the script, you'll receive the following valuable insights:

ðŸ“ˆ Mean Squared Error (MSE): A measure of the model's accuracy.
ðŸ“Š R-squared (R2): A metric indicating the goodness of fit.
ðŸ“‰ Residual Plot: A scatter plot that vividly displays the differences between true and predicted values.
Project Structure
crop_nitrogen_prediction.py: The main Python script that handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Available Regression Models
Our toolkit supports a range of powerful regression models:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Finding the Best Model
Our script automates the process of model selection by identifying the best-performing model based on the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE). The result is conveniently displayed at the end of the execution.

Accepted Crop Types
This application caters to a diverse range of crops for accurate predictions, including but not limited to:

rice
maize
chickpea
kidneybeans
pigeonpeas
mothbeans
mungbean
blackgram
lentil
pomegranate
banana
mango
grapes
watermelon
