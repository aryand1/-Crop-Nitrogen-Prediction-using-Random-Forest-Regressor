# -Crop-Nitrogen-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor
ðŸŒ¾ Crop Nitrogen Prediction


This repository contains a Python script for predicting crop nitrogen levels using the Random Forest Regressor. The script includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

ðŸ“¦ pandas
ðŸ“¦ scikit-learn
ðŸ“¦ matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

**Usage**
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aryand1/crop-nitrogen-prediction.git

Data: The script loads a CSV file containing data. Ensure you have your data in the specified format.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script.

bash
Copy code
python crop_nitrogen_prediction.py



**Output**: The script will provide the following outputs:
ðŸ“ˆ Mean Squared Error (MSE): A measure of the model's accuracy.
ðŸ“Š R-squared (R2): A metric indicating the goodness of fit.
ðŸ“‰ Residual Plot: A scatter plot to visualize the differences between true and predicted values.
**Project Structure**
crop_nitrogen_prediction.py: The main Python script that performs data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Available Regression Models**
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression


**Best-Performing Model**
The script identifies the best-performing model based on the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and displays the result at the end of the execution.

**Accepted Crop Types**
The application accepts the following crop types for prediction:

rice, maize, chickpea, kidneybeans, pigeonpeas, mothbeans, mungbean, blackgram, lentil, pomegranate, banana, mango, grapes, watermelon, muskmelon, apple, orange, papaya, coconut, cotton, jute, coffee

data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing.
